# H6-weather-dashboard

Created a weather dashboard with form inputs
When the user searches for a city
they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.
They can view the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed.
Created divs for future weather conditions for that city.
